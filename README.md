# ü§ñ Agentic AI Memory Management 

This repository contains a series of Google Colab notebooks converted to use the **Google Gemini API**. These notebooks demonstrate advanced agentic concepts like memory management, custom tool use, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by simulating complex functionalities with standard Python and the Gemini API.

## üìä Agent Logic Infographics

To better visualize the complex processes happening within these agents, a series of infographic-style web pages have been created. Each infographic breaks down a specific workflow, explaining the purpose and logic at each step of the agent's "thought" process.

> All infographics are located in the `documents/` directory.

### **üß† Agent Memory: Process & Purpose**

This infographic explains the fundamental concept of how an agent's memory is structured, processed, and used to inform its actions. It covers the core `memory_blocks` and how they are formatted into a prompt.

### **üéÇ Birthday Agent: Process Flow**

This infographic details a simple but powerful workflow where an agent uses a custom tool (`query_birthday_db`) to access an external data source and answer a user's question. It's a clear example of how agents can be extended with custom capabilities.

### **üìö Agentic RAG: Process Flow**

This infographic breaks down the more advanced concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It shows the end-to-end process of ingesting a PDF, creating a vector database, retrieving relevant information, and using that information to generate a fact-based, context-aware answer.

### **‚öôÔ∏è Agent Memory & Tools: Purpose & Flow**

This infographic provides a high-level overview of how an agent uses custom tools to read from and write to its own memory. This enables it to perform complex, stateful tasks like managing a to-do list, demonstrating a more advanced form of agentic behavior.
